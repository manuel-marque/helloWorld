      Welcome to the Royal Kingdom of Colchis
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      Colchis is known in Greek mythology as the destination of the Argonauts,
      as well as the home to Medea and the Golden Fleece. It was also described
      as a land rich with gold, iron, timber and honey that would export its
      resources mostly to ancient Hellenic city-states.
